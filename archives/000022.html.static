<h3>new music fetish</h3>

<p>I've got a new music fetish.  I guess you could call it down-tempo, or maybe it's nu-jazz or acid jazz, no wait, how about, trip-hop....  hmmm.... </p>

<div id="a000022more"><div id="more">
<p>The kind of music my new fetish demands is unclassifiable.  I just don't think it can be done.  So, how would you identify it?  By example....</p>

<p>Let's see:</p>

<p>Gotan Project <a href="http://www.gotanproject.com">site</a><br />
Royksopp (spelled with a wierd 'o' - an umlaut)<br />
St Germain<br />
Groove Armada<br />
Fila Brazillia<br />
DJ Krush<br />
Blame</p>

<p>My fav radio station is Groove Radio @ <a href="http://somafm.com">somafm</a>, but my favorite thing to do is stream rip internet radio all day (and night), then go in and filter it out so it's down to just pure goodness.  man, I love the internet.<br />

<p>obtained in dublin and i thought it was beautiful and relevant: "no music is natural. music is produced only after people invest strenuous and extended effort to gain intimate control over vibrating systems such as vocal cords, a violin, or a synthesizer. all musical instruments are highly contrived technological artifices, they are differentiated not by their degree of naturalness but by the technological periods in which they were developed. the string instruments were perfected when woodworking was a flowering technology, piano designers utilized the processes of a fully industrialised society and the electronic music medium is being developed now at a time when electronic technology  is dominant." -robert a. moog 1997</p>

<p>hey brian, tis i.  dont know if you remember me and tim jones from spanish back in the day.  anyway, clay sent me a link to some audiodregs shit.  i dont know if all that music shit is the kind you listen to and all, but you should check out some of these people since you seem to be into some electronic music.  you've probably heard of aphex twin, which is probably the leader of the IDM genre.  others to check out are boards of canada, my current absolute favorite, e*vax (works with the people on the weird mumbleboy shit), christ, christian kleine, isan, mapstation, plaid, and ulrich schnauss.  its all good stuff, and let me know if you like em.  best way to get em, if you dont already have it, &lt;3soulseek&lt;3  get it at www.slsk.org peace!</p>

<p>Well suck me sideways.  You've followed me through my life even in the years we were off on different paths (actually I guess I followed you since you're 4 months older).  Now you've done it again.  I recently got into downtempo myself.  I just love the stuff, it streams all day and night when I'm working at the computer.  Stop being a freak, let me live my own life without finding out later it was really your life I was living all along!</p>
