<h3>Back in the good ole USofA</h3>

<p>Why does it get so hard to come back from "Europe" every time?  Will I soon become European?  Are these questions to which you would like answers?</p>

<div id="a000027more"><div id="more">
<p>It feels weird being back in the States.  I had an absolute blast in Paris, and I didn't do anything touristy.  Perhaps this is why I had such a great time.  </p>

<p>I guess one of the reasons I'm not so glad to be back is this whole reality thing.  I have to get a job, I have to graduate, I have to move out, I have to grow up, I have to really start paying those bills (my lavish trips to Paris on the credit card, and my extremely posh lifestyle [ read: peanut butter and jelly ] don't come cheap you know)....</p>

<p>But, it is all coming together, I think.  Except for all this schoolwork they expect me to do while I'm busy "graduating."  It is all turning out OK.  I feel refreshed.  Except I shouldn't be, since technically I've been up for more than 24 hours straight except for a nap on the 6 hour plane ride.  But, seriously, I am feeling refreshed about life.  </p>

<p>Wow, you should feel privledged, an actual heart-to-heart entry on a weblog.  Mark it in the calendars folks, a middle-class white kid with his own website just told you way too much information.  I like it, run with it....</p>

<p>Now, back to achieving the American Dream.</p>

<p>CBQ is a blogger.  Who'd a thunk it?</p>

<p>I'm guilty too.  I won't lie.</p>

<p>But at least you have a girlfriend.  All I have is my livejournal.  And beer!  God Bless us all, and little Timmy too.</p>

<p>I can write my name in the snow...</p>
