<h3>one more time guys</h3>

<p>If I hear one more time from someone (I almost wrote: republican/conservative/nut-job) that John Kerry is a flip-flopper, I am going to flip out and change my mind about how I deal with that comment.  That's right, I'm going to change my mind--flip-flop if you will.  Before, I thought it was pretty funny.  Haha, funny, I get it, he changes his mind, you can't trust him, eh, eh, eh?  </p>

<p>Hmmmm.  I wish John Kerry (and others) would just come out and say: "You know what, I, like 70% of America was for the war after that day, September 10th (or 11th or whatever day that was), but now I've seen a few things, learned the truth (or even the lack there-of) and now, like most Americans, am against it." </p>

<p>There.  I'm done.  OK, now honestly, don't send me the link to the video where John Kerry is debating himself, haha, I get it, he flip-flops!  Don't send me any more stuff on that shit.  What I will take links for is something not related to this war on Iraq.  I'm done. </p>

<p>How about, some links to the "other debate" - the one between <a href="http://www.c-span.org/search/basic.asp?ResultStart=1&ResultCount=10&BasicQueryText=badnarik+cobb&image1.x=0&image1.y=0">David Cobb and Michael Badnarik</a>?  Or what about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/01/0535239">12 questions with David Cobb</a> of the Green Party (on slashdot).  My favorite line:<br />
<div class="comments-body"><br />
We need a viable political alternative [to the two-party system] because we need to manufacture democracy here at home before we can export it.<br />
</div></p>

<p>Do yourself a favor, find out about the other issues (not this war in Iraq--however silly/important/far-fetched/vital you think it is to your vote).  Here's some that you might find of interest: election reform, the fair tax, national single payer health insurance, educational reform, peace, racial/social/economic equality, off-shoring/out-sourcing, patent/copyright laws, gun-rights, ... hmmm.... </p>

<p>I just don't want to have to remove my tools off the rack, ship them overseas, and train my replacement.</p>

<p>In other anger, Movable type filters out image HTML code.  Also you can right click on my link, because aparently, I can't make it open in a new window either.  This thing doesn't force me to spell right.</p>

<p>Well, check this out anyway.  You will like it.</p>

<p>okay, so i'm now listening to the no robots allowed streaming radio station...using itunes on winxp no less...the stream it replaced was eastern oregon college radio, keol...which i enjoyed most of the time...ne-way there is a(nother) presidential debate going on right now, but instead of watching it, i'm watching a "copying" progress bar so i can do our company's weekly backup and then leave the office for a weekend of being on call 24/7... ain't life grand? ...it is by the way, and very soon i will have a gallery of pictures to prove it...til then, robots unite!</p>
