      <h1>Charles Brian Quinn</h1>
      <h2>strengths</h2>
      <p>
I am competitive, motivated, and a self-starter.  I am entrepreneurial (enjoy starting things up) and enjoy maintaining control over projects and leading the charge, or as my wonderful wife puts it: “in any group, people tend to look to you for guidance and leadership — others ask you to take charge and enjoy your direction."  I am always positive, optimistic, and find energy in leading others.  I am confident and able to persuade people to join the cause, and able to inspire others to reach their maximum potential even in challenging situations. I have high operational goals for myself and others and expect all involved to provide 100% effort.  I’m adaptive and open to new ideas and change: I will react, adjust, and modify behavior in a variety of situations.  I need variety in projects, environment (freedom to move around in office or new locations), and groups/teams to be most effective.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
I work towards making things happen (bias towards action).  I can juggle many projects and activities simultaneously.  I demand high performance of my self and others on my teams.  I am a great presenter: engaging and skilled at verbal expression, and can deliver messages confidently: persuasively, or authoritatively if needed.  I am able to build trust, credibility, and rapport.  I am able to make decisions quickly and like sharing the credit and accepting the blame for the outcome of decisions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
I am seeking a strong, visible group or organization with which to identify.  In my most recent roles, I have either created or co-created the culture, brand, values, and/or mission of which I become a fierce defender and promoter.  I am great at hiring, mentoring, managing, and giving constructive feedback: managing up and down to the results that really matter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
I love technology, software, and new, innovative ideas and concepts. Yes, I will be the first to signup for the cybernetic implant in my skull, and yes, I own cryptocurrency, stream my VR rig gaming on Twitch, and chances are good that I've read that sci-fi book.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>weaknesses</h2>
      <p>
I regularly maintain a sense of urgency that can be perceived as impatience. I have been known to become easily bored by mundane or routine projects, even with my ability to inject creativity and spontaneity to the tasks at hand.  I can lose interest in a project or initiative once the challenge is gone and it becomes more of a routine. I can become restless and impatient for those who do not share my vision, overly complex processes, and slow-moving work. I need a system of support for follow-through and loose-ends.  I often set overly ambitious, somewhat-unrealistic expectations and can come across a bit aggressive and dominating, only hearing what I want to hear at times.
      </p>
      <h2>seeking</h2>
      <p>
I am looking to start, run, or lead a division/area of an organization with real P&amp;L responsibility.  While I love the true early stage startup, and self-identify as entrepreneurial ("that needs to exist, let's create it"), most of my previous successes have <b>not</b> been in the very early "let's buy the domain and setup the email accounts" stage, but I can do that too.
