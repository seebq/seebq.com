<h3>New York, New York</h3>

<p>A trip to the big apple...</p>

<div id="a000139more"><div id="more">
<p>So, I finally went to New York.  I had never been to do the touristy thing (I think I was in the airport there once but that doesn't count).  I had a blast.  New York is just so big and extravagant, everything is just so oversized, so utterly capitalistic, it's actually quite cool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a> and I left Sunday, very early and flew into Newark.  It was actually snowing pretty hard, and although it wasn't hard to find a shuttle/bus into Manhattan, it took a long time to drive through the snow.  We checked in at the <a href="http://www.ianschragerhotels.com/home.html">Hudson</a>, which was absolutely fabulous:  <i>"Hudson is the next generation of Cheap Chic - stylish, democratic, affordable, young at heart and utterly cool."</i>  Jodi and I are a fan of Philippe Stark's design, I don't think we could have stayed anywhere cooler.  </p>

<p>After checking in (room 666!) we made our way out to some Museums, ate an awesome lunch at <a href="http://www.swinyc.com/newsroom/brasserie.htm">Brasserie</a>, then hit the town again.  We had some amazing dinners, thanks to some recommendations from friends (Hi Doug, Roy, and Katherine!).</p>

<p>We met up with a friend of ours, Casey Nixon, one of those Northerners that talks a mile a minute (just kidding, Casey), and saw the Empire State Building, Times Square at Night, Broadway, and the MoMa Design Store.  </p>

<p>We also made it to the Brooklyn Bridge, and even went to a Broadway Play (<a href="http://www.playbill.com/events/event_detail/3069.html">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a>, starring Ashley Judd).  Let's see, we also went to the Statue of Liberty, did some shopping, and well, I'll just let you see for yourself.  The gallery is up at:</p>
