<h3 class="title">Happenings</h3>

<p>I've been pretty busy recently, and have been loving every minute of it!  </p>

<p>Last Sunday we launched an Alpha version of our baby, Meople.  It's up at <a href="http://www.meople.net/">http://www.meople.net/</a>, though it's invite only.  If you want to be an Alpha user (get hounded for feedback on how everything works, looks, feels, etc.), let me know.  Everything is going stellar on this end, working crazy hours, writing crazy amounts of code, working with some crazy-good developers, and learning crazy amounts of "stuff."</p>

<p>Last Tuesday, the First Re-meeting of the <a href="http://www.atlrug.org/">Atlanta Ruby Users Group</a> was awesome -- thanks to Obie Fernandez for giving a Q&A Session on the Rails Framework for Ruby and fending off the skeptics.  </p>

<p>Last Thursday, my presentation on Templating Engines in PHP for the <a href="http://www.atlphp.org/">Atlanta PHP User's Group</a> went really well -- and I got a lot of good feedback.  Slides are up on the PHP site.</p>

<p>Jodi and I had a little soiree this Saturday for our good friends and family (and to promote our condo a little bit).... The condo has been on the market now for about a month, and everyone who sees it is simply amazed.  We put so much work into that condo, that it will be sad to leave, but you can be sure we've already started on the next place and it will be 10 times more fabulous.</p>

<p>I had to cancel my fa.cetio.us server account, and re-set it up -- I wasn't gentoo-savvy enough to maintain it correctly -- and unfortunately messed it up for a friend of mine whom I was sharing it with (Sorry Necrotic!).  I'm in the process of getting it setup correctly, for production use, just for e-mail/web/etc.  I may have to get one just for random project development, but I've got plenty of dev boxes to go around without paying for one. We'll see how that goes.  I'm getting pretty daggone good with Gentoo, now, so watch out....</p>

<h3 class="title">my life is a textarea box</h3>

<p>Damn!  I just wrote the longest entry on how our condo is <a href="http://fmlslistings.marketlinx.com/SearchDetail/Scripts/PrtBuyFul/PrtBuyFul.asp?prp=mls&AgentId=GOODJACK&EmailKey=8213883">for sale</a>, including a listing to the unit, my take on the condo market, describing how much work we put into the unit, blah, blah, blah, and it's gone.  The Internet ate my entry.</p>

<p>Seems like my entire life is one big textarea -- we live inside these horrible web-apps, and technology is supposed to make things easier, but here I am bitching inside another textarea box, hoping that I don't hit the backspace key while not focused in this little box, making me go Back a page, and losing all this bitching.</p>

<p>Damn!</p>

<h3 class="title">Screen on the Green and web dev</h3>

<p>Last night I went to <a href="http://atlanta.about.com/od/events/a/scronthegreen.htm">Piedmont Park's Screen on the Green</a> for the showing of "Mommie Dearest."  And while I didn't stay for the whole movie (I am getting so old, I know), I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I met Jodi on the lawn in the back with our doggy, Jameson, and we ate Cafe Sampan Chicken (mmmmm) while Jameson tried to attack everyone (don't know why she does that).</p>

<p>Sticking out in my mind were the old, southern, redneck, gay guys (ahh, Atlanta) sitting near us who kept yelling at people to sit down, and the responses they got back.  Sigh.  I'm one of those guys who really doesn't like being confrontational, but one that likes seeing other people be confrontational, and laughing about it.  Reminds me of the time I was driving and saw a driver across the intersection get cut off.  The driver immediately blasted his horn and then proceeded to stick his middle finger up and lean way forward, cursing in his car.  I was sitting at the intersection, and couldn't help but start laughing, it was just too hilarious how angry this guy was.  The woman next to me heard/saw me, and started laughing too, and shook her head.</p>

<p>I think people go around all day with so much stress that they just lay it all out at inappropriate times.  Why can't we all just get along?</p>

<p>In other news, I'm steeped in database schemas, php code, templating engines, and CSS style sheets for large-scale web application development, and writing ASP.NET C# web applications, .NET compact-framework mobile application development in C# -- busy every second of the day and loving it!</p>

<h3 class="title">a pretend post</h3>

<p>Let's just pretend that this entry in my blog is actually several different entries that I've been meaning to write.  I'm just going to summarize what these non-posted entries would have been (and since I started work on some, but never actually posted them), maybe they'll just show up one day.</p>

<p>Non-Post 1) More griping and some random-ness about XML.  This post was going to show how to do some XSL transformations to make an XML doc do all sorts of nifty stuff.  It was going to be well written and link to <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/index.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">different</a> sites where I found out how to do whatever it was I was trying to do.  (This entry would have served to show how techno-savvy and cool I was, and boost my own ego, while adding more clutter to the Interweb about XML/XSL).</p>

<p>Non-Post 2) Talking about how I went crazy and ran all kinds of wires through our condo while our bathroom renovation had much of the walls and ceiling removed.  I ran tons of CAT6 (high-speed network cable) and lots of UL-Approved 4-gauge Speaker wire - in order to complete my insanely cool, whole-house-audio/video linux-based <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">mythtv</a> and iTunes system using volume controls, auto-switching local amplifiers, in-ceiling and in-wall speakers, and a projector on the wall.  (once again would have provided some links and more boosting to the old ego -- don't worry I'll be posting more about this system soon).</p>

<p>Non-Post 3) All about my new Linux Laptop.  I just acquired an ....</p>

<p>.... IBM Thinkpad T30 and proceed to install (my fav distro) Fedora Core 3 and in general, juice this baby up to provide a sweet little web-dev environment for my newest project.  I have tons of links to various sites and people for getting things like ACPI setup, wireless Internet, and cool little extras.  (this would have been a good post).</p>

<p>Non-Post 4) Complete Random updates on how my life's been.  Mother's Day was great (Love you <a href="http://www.roselynquinn.com/">Mom</a>!), my Grandad's birthday was last Friday (he's a regular Internet Stud, you can find him on MSN Game Zone playing Bridge, but sorry ladies, he is already quite smitten with a certain lady).  We thought Jameson got Kennel Cough from Puppy-Day-Care (you can laugh, but it is the best thing ever - she loves it too).  The bathroom/closet renovation is taking forever, but going to be awesome.  <a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a> is going to New York this weekend for the <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/icff">ICFF</a> and I wish I was too!  Everything is peachy!</p>

<p>Phew.  That was easy.</p>

<h3 class="title">hurry up the bandwagon is almost full</h3>

<p>Everyone hurry!  The bandwagon is almost full!  <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/">Yahoo 360</a> went live!  If you're not one of the lucky ones to get an invite, you're out.  How will you ever catch up?</p>

<p>Just went on a blogrolling spree, that started on a yahoo 360 preview, went through the rankings of yahoo employees, saw some friends in the Valley (troutgirl, ifindkarma), and then down into flickr-dom....  I also found this great parody of all the "social-networking" sites that is all too funny:</p>

<h3 class="title">letting it all out</h3>

<p>The whole blogging process is hard to explain to people.  Why would you want to put your journal on-line?  Why would your day-to-day musings be of any importance to the "World Wide Web" - the global community of people all around the world?  Who cares?</p>

<p>Well, <i>I</i> care.  Maybe, it's just for me.  In case you haven't noticed, the title of this page, is "shameless self promotion."  </p>

<p>And, maybe it isn't for the global community, but rather the community that is formed by me and my friends.  Or maybe, again, it's just me.</p>

<p>So I'm going to just accept it, and let it all out.  I'm going to share myself with me.</p>

<p>This entry is coming off as defensive, when I really wanted it to be more of a discovery -- or a justification.  I find that many of my blog postings never go live.  I'll write about how much I despise travel, or want to link to some really funny, really dirty jokes, or good reads.  Man, fuck it!  I'm just going to post and link everything!  I'm letting it all out!</p>

<h3 class="title">it's good to be home</h3>

<p>Ahhh, it's good to be home.  Lots of news on the home-front as well.  I've taken a new job, and it is quite frankly, awesome.  I'm working for US Micro Corporation as a go-to guy on various Technology projects (sorry no link, the web-site is one of the projects).  The first involving deploying a Service-Enabled architecture comprising a Windows Mobile (Pocket PC) front-end for some slick mobile PDA smartphones that call a web-service on a secure App Server which in turn runs applications on their Navision server running on SQL.  It's quite impressive.  The next few projects on the horizon are looking good too!  More importantly, this job places me near the ultimate goal, which is to not only empower myself through future opportunities like this one, but empowering other people to seek and obtain opportunities and succeed in their dreams!</p>

<p>It was tough leaving <a href="http://www.jacada.com">Jacada</a> -- what an amazing place to work, filled with incredibly smart, energetic people.  I was sad to leave (and so were many of my co-workers), but they too were excited about my future possibilities.  I can't thank them enough for helping me succeed.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience in every aspect of joining the company, succeeding in the company, and leaving the company.  This is how business should be done.</p>

<p>This is all part of the plan, though.  It's good to be here.</p>

<h3 class="title">keeping up with the cyber-joneses</h3>

<p>It's so hard to keep up with the cyber-joneses, these days.  I mean, it's hard enough to keep your blog's content fresh with all your day-to-day musings, your completely original political stirrings, and favorite song of the week (it's my: <a href="http://www.livejournal.org">livejournal</a>'s <em>mood: somber, song: dashboard confessional</em>), let alone make sure your content-management-system of the week (be it, <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">movabletype</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a>, or any other wiki-type tool) is up to date, with the latest plug-ins, spam-blasters, and tools-you-can't-live-without.  And, lest your php installation falls behind, and have you updated mysql recently, or apache, or (gasp) your kernel?  You mean, you're still using Fedora Core 2?  Oh my.  Quick, apt-get/yum and force update everything, pray you're not going to have to read through the logs and join 3 mailing lists to find out why your installation is hung, and then curse open-source (only under your breath though)!</p>

<p>OK, so while you're updating everything, make sure that you're fullying utilizing your <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a> tags (and pinging technorati regularly), while folksonmizing (ooooh did I invent the verbage form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomy</a>?) and making your bookmarks are available on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and oh my gosh, your <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> blog and mo-blog needs the pictures from that party last night!  And oh my, all those invites from friends on &lt;insert-Yet-Another-Social-Networking-Site here&gt; are waiting for your approval!  Your social networks are waning, your e-mail needs checking, and it's time to blog-roll all your friend's blogs....</p>

<p>sigh....  those cyberjoneses!</p>

<h3 class="title">the obligatory new year's post</h3>

<p>Happy New Year!  Every time the calendar rolls around, as much as you try to fight it - nostalgia hits you.  Everyone tries to look back on the past and look forward to the future.  I'm no different.</p>

<p>It's been a long time for seebq.com.  From the earliest days, back in 1999 when domains could only be bought from networksolutions.com at 75 bucks a pop, to the recent incarnation - a decent attempt at a blog and photo-gallery with random musings, projects, and well.... lots of junk.</p>

<p>Where to next?  Well, the cool-guy in me doesn't want this blog to turn into the next <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">lj</a>-like diary of a hipster, even though I really yearn to post every day about what I bought at the store today along with music lyrics and IM conversations.  The hacker in me wants this blog to become uber-l33t, by installing lots of goodies like <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">automatic spam-detection</a>, mobile blogging tools, <a href="http://www.norobotsallowed.com">streaming radio stations</a>, and open-source goodness while documenting for everyone, every step.  And, the sappy-guy in me just wants to post pictures of my doggy, condo renovations, and my girl, <a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a>.  </p>

<p>Where will seebq.com go from here?  Who knows....</p>

<h3 class="title">awesome wireless spot</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.beerknurd.com">Flying Saucer</a> in Nashville, TN, has to be the coolest wi-fi spot I have ever seen in my entire life.  Not only do they serve literally hundreds of beers, but all the waitresses wear tight shirts that say very un-clever things like "beer goddess" and short plaid skirts with knee-high white socks.  Unbelievable.  And the <a href="http://www.beerknurd.com/">web-site</a> is just so out of control it is almost cool.  If you ever find yourself on your third government contracted software consulting project in downtown Nashville, wasting your life away, I suggest you spend some quality time here.  </p>

<p>p.s. I am blogging from this place as we speak (wooo the power of the inter-web)</p>

<h3 class="title">philly, dogg!</h3>

<p>I just got back from Philly last night--my company shipped me off Tuesday night.  Since I only had two nights, I made the best of it.  This meant some bar and restaurant hopping.  First stop, <a href="http://philadelphia.citysearch.com/profile/11529942">Morimoto</a> for some sushi and a sake-inspired martini.  This place was so trendy it hurt.  Good sushi too (from the little bit I had and saw).  Next up, <a href="http://www.buddakan.com/">Buddakan</a> to worship the giant buddha and enjoy a tuna-wasabi-pizza (and another martini).  Not too shabby.  I hopped a few more bars, ending up at <a href="http://www.paradigmrestaurant.com/">Paradigm</a> where they have a bathroom that is totally glass, and when you go in and lock the door, it frosts the glass (by applying a tiny electric charge).  Very hott!  A few martinis later and it was time to stumble back to my hotel.  </p>

<p>Philly was cool, I just wish I had more time to explore.  Maybe I'll head back there soon.  Next week is Nashville for one more go-around, then San Francisco for some good ole-fashioned consulting work.</p>

<h3 class="title">omaha - rare. well done.</h3>

<p>"Omaha: Rare. Well Done."  reads the sign on the entrance banner from the airport.  Omaha is actually, pretty cool.  There's some wierd stuff out here, for instance, across the street from my hotel is ConAgra (fortune x00 mega-company), just across from a large "lake" is a fountain that shoots water 100s of feet in the air, constantly chaning color--the perfect backdrop to a huge multi-story Harrah's casino, and quite a few failed loft-style developments.  Just down the street is Mutual of Omaha, another fortune x00 mega-company, and an extremely cool downtown "old-market" area that despite all the failed developments is doing quite well (from the looks of it).  Definitely rare.  Sure, well done too.</p>

<p>I'm here for a 3-day training course on my company's product at Nebraska Methodist Health Services.  I was here just a month ago to teach the same course at Mutual of Omaha, I just learned both companies use the same mainframe systems, so naturally our company is loving the shared business.</p>

<p>I enjoy teaching, especially when the students are anxious to learn - I enjoy the challenge of coming to an entirely new place, finding new ways to explain concepts, and well - ok let's be honest, I liked it at first because it was challenging, heck, I was thrown in there after just learning the ropes, but that's why I liked it.  Now, it's getting to be routine.  I do enjoy it when my students are anxious to learn, and not just thrown in to some course to satisfy their company's traning quota.  I also like the power and respect of being that consultant who's backed by a lotta bucks (I was going to be honest, remember).  I guess I'm still frazzled (read: bitter) from the never-ending gov't contract project that keeps going and going - thanks tax-payers, I'm now a Marriott Platinum, and racking up tons of worthless SkyMiles!</p>

<p>How did I get so jaded?  And bored....</p>

<h3 class="title">Vacation from my problems</h3>

<p>Countdown to completion of the TDOC project - 2 weeks!  Tonight was wierd - all of a sudden the key players in such a large (read: expensive) project all showed up for a sort-of "thank you dinner" (and lo and behold the subcontractor's president picked up the tab)!  It takes money to make money, but does it take that kind of money?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a> is excited about our new puppy, Jameson, she should be coming home with us soon.  We were planning on going on vacation this weekend, down to Florida, but alas, a <a href="http://www.weather.com/maps/news/atlstorm9/index_large.html">few things</a> came up.  We may still go on mini-vacation, kind of like when Bob in "What About Bob?" went on his "vacation from my problems!"  I like the idea of this--rent a few movies, cook dinner, stay at home, but I, unfortunately, have problems staying away from work/computer/internet.  I will most likely end up hacking on my <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">mythtv box</a>, doing <a href="http://www.quinnfx.com/">web work</a>, and getting into trouble, instead of vacationing.  Ahh, but wouldn't that be nice?</p>

<p>Funny how when you are always out of town, it's just so nice to be back "in town," doesn't matter what you do....</p>

<p>Omaha, NE next week - a 3 day course!  Piece of cake!</p>
