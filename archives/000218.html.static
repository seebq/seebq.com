<h3>Civics Lessons</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://reason.com/brickbats/bb-2004.shtml">Reason Magazine's Daily Brickbat</a> by Charles Oliver: <br />
<div class="comments-body"><br />
Benjamin Traslavina, a 16-year-old high school student, got an important<br />
lesson in politics and criminal justice at the Republican National<br />
Convention. Traslavina, vice president of his school's Honor Society, was<br />
selected to attend the convention by the Junior Statesmen Foundation, a<br />
group that tries to interest students in government. He was there when<br />
AIDS protestors tried to disrupt a speech by White House Chief of Staff<br />
Andrew Card. Traslavina stood up to get a photograph of the protest for<br />
his high school newspaper, which he edits. That's when Secret Service<br />
grabbed him. They turned him over to New York City police, despite the<br />
protestors telling them he wasn't part of their group and despite his<br />
credentials, which were seized along with his camera. He was handcuffed<br />
and his film thrown away. Traslavina was hauled off to jail. For the next<br />
12 hours his family tried to find him. Police didn't let him make a call<br />
until after midnight. He was arraigned on a felony charge of inciting a<br />
riot and misdemeanor charges of assault and disorderly conduct and<br />
released the next afternoon. No word on what this did to his interest in<br />
government. </div></p>
