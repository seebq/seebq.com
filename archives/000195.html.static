<h3>seebq got a job</h3>

<p>You heard it right.  I sold out to the man....</p>

<div id="a000195more"><div id="more">
<p>First, a little history lesson.</p>

<p>May 2003, I graduated from Georgia Tech and decided I was going to start my own company, right then and there.  I have a couple of ideas on what I want to do, and a couple of things I was already doing.  One of my ideas involves a custom car computer hardware/software integrator company.  Although the idea is technically on the back-burner, I still haven't given up hope yet.  Let's just leave it at that.</p>

<p>At that time, I was still doing contract work for various companies (web development, IT stuff, etc.), while waiting tables at one of my favorite restaurants, Eclipse Di Luna.  The contract work was/is nice, but so time-consuming and well, sometimes just not worth the time, to be honest.</p>

<p>Things were going well, but I just felt stuck.  I can't explain it, perhaps life in the service industry just left me feeling a little mind-less.  So, I sold out to the man.  But, I'm loving it.</p>

<p>Flash forward to February 2004.  I'm working at a company called <a href="http://www.jacada.com/">Jacada</a>, and I really do love it.  My official title is Product Consultant, but I'm doing a little bit of everything -- software development, semi-pre-sales consulting, proof-of-concept implementations, and maybe even a little project management.  Work has taken me to Nashville, DC, and soon, Boston.  I actually enjoy the traveling--while it is pretty often, it is very empowering to be given so much responsibility and independence for completing projects.</p>

<p>So, now I've got my hands are full, just the way I like it.</p>

<p>I'll go ahead and let you in on some of the "big" stuff I'm working on:<br />
- Making my server break even / or even turn a profit!  Know anyone that wants a web-site, cheap?<br />
- <a href="http://www.elfurioso.com">el furioso</a> is going to be Big one day, you just wait.  Film Festivals, t-shirts, site updates, you name it.  Come be a fan, so you can say you knew us before we sold out for millions.<br />
- hacking the crap out of my new <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/communicators/index.jhtml">Treo 600</a><br />
- Redesigning my family's condo with <a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a> - a new slick <a href="http://www.poliformatlanta.com/">kitchen</a>, whole-home audio/video system, and some slick, modern, bau-haus style furnishings.<br />
- and more....</p>

<p>Thanks for tuning in,<br />
