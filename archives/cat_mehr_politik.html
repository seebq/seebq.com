<h3 class="title">bush won</h3>

<p>I just wish I only had one word to say:  goddamnit.  </p>

<p>But I don't.  I have quite a few words to say.  First, let me say that life will go on with Dubya as president.  America will continue to shine as the beacon of....aww fuck it....  America has an antiquated form of government that bases modern day decisions like partial-birth abortions, gay-marriage rights, deterrence/proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other such gems on a system comprised of a document enscribed by several old, white men wearing tights and wigs, escaping religious "persecution," created with the intentions that it would be easy to <i>amend</i> for the changing times, and a system of checks and balances that would ensure government would be run by the people, for the peo...  like I said, fuck it.</p>

<p>Well, you gotta think that the rest of the world with its &lt;sarcasm&gt;gay-loving, french-sympathizing, baby-killing, gun-hating &lt;/sarcasm&gt; out-look on life is thinking, (along with, oh, say 48% of America) what the fuck? </p>

<p>OK, so it can't be that bad, right?  As my pal <a href="http://www.omarzaki.com">Omar</a> reminds me: "Just remember my friend, it's never as good as the people who won say it is, but by the same token, it's never as bad as the losers will have you think."</p>

<p>For sure, though, as Americans, we can't make informed decisions (vote) or base our public-policy on what other people (the rest of the planet) think all the time, but for sure, maybe we should garner a little bit more support in the world-court (or whatever you'd like to call it) for our efforts.  If we really think something like imposing a democracy on Iraq, outlawing people having sex with members of the opposite sex, utilizing semi-automatic assault rifles with armor-piercing bullets for killing "deer," and implementing a Homeland Security policy complete with meaningless color-coded terror levels, maybe we should take a minute to think about the long-term implications for future generations.  Maybe.</p>

<p>OK, so what values should we base our decisions on?  When a majority of Americans seem to believe that the US is a experiencing a decline in moral  values (it started with that damn Clinton), well just what do we do?  Elect a leader whose Christian values of prayer and going to church and declaring gay marriage illegal?  No.  Unfortunately, most Americans may not admit it, but the values we share are hard work, intelligence, and, well, money.  Insert compasionate-conservative-gasp-at-crazy-liberal-view here.</p>

<p>Well, Omar, you are correct sir, maybe it's not that bad.  After all, he's only the Commander-In-Chief, and we do have several checks and balances (like our soon-to-be-even-more-conservative Supreme Court and GOP-majority House and Senate) to keep everything fair and balanced and running like a well oiled governmental machine.  I mean, the presidency may be an important job, but it's still a government job, and man do those suck.</p>

<p>I'm done.  Here's your recap:  George Bush won.  It sucks.  Election Reform.</p>

<h3 class="title">your vote counts</h3>

<p>"Of Course Your Vote Counts" by <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/corr_colbert.jhtml">Stephen Colbert</a><br />
<div class="comments-body"><br />
In every election, many people grapple with the nagging suspicion that their vote doesn't count. As a citizen and someone who's always right, it is respectively my duty and pleasure to tell them, they're wrong.  In fact, our democracy depends on every citizen recognizing the value of their vote.</p>

<p>And here's the value of that vote.  In the most recent presidential election around 105,360,260 people cast ballots. That means each persons vote counted:</p>

<p>.000000949 %</p>

<p>I defy you to find a mathmetician who will tell you that number is less than or equal to 0.</p>

<p>Ok, so we can agree that your vote counts.  It counts:</p>

<p>.000000949 %</p>

<p>Swish that around in your mouth for a while.  How does it taste?  Taste like freedom?  Because to me it tastes like jack-off-squat.</p>

<p>This brings up a related, better question than "does your vote count," namely, does your vote make a difference? To answer that perhaps a more visual comparison would be more illustriative.</p>

<p>Imagine your vote as a deer tick, and the election as the continent of Asia.  Do you notice the relative size of these two things?  See how the deer tick appears in comparison with the largest continent on earth? This gives you a rough idea of the difference your vote makes vis-a-vis the entire electorate.</p>

<p>But there is good news.  Due to the rampant and growing cynicism of people who feel their vote doesn't make a difference, voter turnout is steadily decreasing.  Where this cyciscm comes from escapes me, but what it means that with each electoral cycle the value of one vote increases.  </p>

<p>Now, it's difficult to imagine the day when the candidates running don't vote so that's two votes right there.  But it's not difficult to imagine a day when only one other person bothers to vote.  And oh, what a valuable vote that would be....</p>

<p>You're welcome.<br />
</div></p>

<p>Taken from <a href="http://shop.comedycentral.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1859389">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart presents: America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction</a>, and actually I dictated from the Audiobook.  This is a hilarious book, the audiobook is done really well, too.</p>

<h3 class="title">one more time guys</h3>

<p>If I hear one more time from someone (I almost wrote: republican/conservative/nut-job) that John Kerry is a flip-flopper, I am going to flip out and change my mind about how I deal with that comment.  That's right, I'm going to change my mind--flip-flop if you will.  Before, I thought it was pretty funny.  Haha, funny, I get it, he changes his mind, you can't trust him, eh, eh, eh?  </p>

<p>Hmmmm.  I wish John Kerry (and others) would just come out and say: "You know what, I, like 70% of America was for the war after that day, September 10th (or 11th or whatever day that was), but now I've seen a few things, learned the truth (or even the lack there-of) and now, like most Americans, am against it." </p>

<p>There.  I'm done.  OK, now honestly, don't send me the link to the video where John Kerry is debating himself, haha, I get it, he flip-flops!  Don't send me any more stuff on that shit.  What I will take links for is something not related to this war on Iraq.  I'm done. </p>

<p>How about, some links to the "other debate" - the one between <a href="http://www.c-span.org/search/basic.asp?ResultStart=1&ResultCount=10&BasicQueryText=badnarik+cobb&image1.x=0&image1.y=0">David Cobb and Michael Badnarik</a>?  Or what about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/01/0535239">12 questions with David Cobb</a> of the Green Party (on slashdot).  My favorite line:<br />
<div class="comments-body"><br />
We need a viable political alternative [to the two-party system] because we need to manufacture democracy here at home before we can export it.<br />
</div></p>

<p>Do yourself a favor, find out about the other issues (not this war in Iraq--however silly/important/far-fetched/vital you think it is to your vote).  Here's some that you might find of interest: election reform, the fair tax, national single payer health insurance, educational reform, peace, racial/social/economic equality, off-shoring/out-sourcing, patent/copyright laws, gun-rights, ... hmmm.... </p>

<h3 class="title">now i get it</h3>

<p>I was listening to talk-radio the other day, and to be honest, I listen to several talk-radio programmes every Monday and Friday on my drive to/from Nashville.  We all know that radio is where the right-wing nut jobs hang out, c'mon y'all, let's admit it.  I think as soon as you can accept that radio DJs have only 2 real objectives, the better off you are.</p>

<p>1) Entertainment.  Pure, and simple.  Yes, Rush Limbaugh is upset.  He is, in fact, yelling.  And, yes, he is always up in arms about something.  If you don't agree, chances are you'll listen and laugh (or get mad at him).  If you do happen to agree (after or before the yelling), chances are you'll listen and just get madder with him.  Damn that <a href="http://www.cbs.com">liberal gay jew run media</a>.</p>

<p>2) Commercials.  I believe <a href="http://www.hannity.com">Sean Hannity</a> put this one best, when he was talking about something or other, repeating something about 9/11 changing how he walks his dog, and then he told me about 1-800-USA-DOOR -- which provides quality overhead and garage doors, built in America.  He says that they do "extensive criminal background checks, and drug-screening of all their service technicians," so it's safe!  No, wait, I believe it was <a href="http://www.boortz.com">Neal Boortz</a> (Atlanta, GA syndicated) who was talking about vinyl siding, or was it gutter cleaning or fucking-old-people-insurance, and you know, he did mention clearly that the terrorists were going to come into your home and bomb your duplex and rape your dog and steal your wife and drink the milk straight from the jug without using a glass if you didn't get real scared and buy American Products.  I think that was the gist of it.</p>

<p>I'm so over talk-radio.  How about, <a href="http://www.pocket-tunes.com/">pTunes</a> on my Treo600, streaming one of those ShoutCast Radio stations?  Now if only I could find a <a href="http://www.norobotsallowed.com">good one</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">those silly neoconservatives</h3>

<p>The Cato Institute daily has an article by Jonathan Clarke (also ran on Sep 22 in the LA Times) entitled <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/09-24-04.html">An Ominous U.S. Model</a> that spells out some scary truths.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
Over the past weeks, the Russian people have been subjected to terrorist assaults and losses on a scale broadly equivalent to 9/11. In critical ways, therefore, the two countries are coping with a parallel challenge. If Russia's leaders looked to the U.S. response to 9/11 as a model, what would they see?
</div>

<p>He asserts two scary scenarios.  </p>

<div class="comments-body">
The American response to 9/11 has been almost exclusively military.  Other instruments of American policy -- political, economic, social, allies -- have fallen by the wayside. All other priorities of government have been subordinated to the "war on terrorism." This approach of total "with us or against us" war derives much of its ideological underpinning from the intensely pessimistic neoconservative worldview based on an absolute division between good and evil.
</div>

<p>Even more scary is that is approach tends to place more power in the hands of the "central executive" (George W).</p>

<div class="comments-body">
Second, the Russians will see that, for U.S. policymakers, 9/11 legitimated unrelated policy objectives, notably the attack on Iraq. Conceived in the mid- 1990s, this neoconservative scheme for Iraq was based on a pipe dream of imposing U.S.-style democracy throughout the Middle East. A noble enough aspiration about which a national debate would have been in order, but one that the neoconservatives knew would never stand critical public scrutiny. Hence the obfuscations about weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein's links to terrorism to take advantage of the in-theater presence of American forces in Afghanistan for the purposes of a war against Iraq.
</div>

<p>In my opinion, if any country decides to wage a war on terrorism--the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons--they may consider attacking the largest terrorist "group" in history: us.</p>

<h3 class="title">Civics Lessons</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://reason.com/brickbats/bb-2004.shtml">Reason Magazine's Daily Brickbat</a> by Charles Oliver: <br />
<div class="comments-body"><br />
Benjamin Traslavina, a 16-year-old high school student, got an important<br />
lesson in politics and criminal justice at the Republican National<br />
Convention. Traslavina, vice president of his school's Honor Society, was<br />
selected to attend the convention by the Junior Statesmen Foundation, a<br />
group that tries to interest students in government. He was there when<br />
AIDS protestors tried to disrupt a speech by White House Chief of Staff<br />
Andrew Card. Traslavina stood up to get a photograph of the protest for<br />
his high school newspaper, which he edits. That's when Secret Service<br />
grabbed him. They turned him over to New York City police, despite the<br />
protestors telling them he wasn't part of their group and despite his<br />
credentials, which were seized along with his camera. He was handcuffed<br />
and his film thrown away. Traslavina was hauled off to jail. For the next<br />
12 hours his family tried to find him. Police didn't let him make a call<br />
until after midnight. He was arraigned on a felony charge of inciting a<br />
riot and misdemeanor charges of assault and disorderly conduct and<br />
released the next afternoon. No word on what this did to his interest in<br />
government. </div></p>
