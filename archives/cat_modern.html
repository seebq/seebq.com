<h3 class="title">our place featured on hgtv</h3>

<p>Jodi and I have been asked to feature our home on <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/shows_hgftm">HGTV's What You Get For The Money</a>!  We are super excited, and quite a bit nervous.  The film crew arrives Tuesday and are filming all day -- to be completely honest, we were literally just notified on Friday evening that we "made the cut" and will be in an upcoming episode!</p>

<p>This is just huge news for us -- <a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a>'s natural talent shines through:  her hard work, design, and attention to detail is evident in everything she does.  Our condo is just simply amazing.  To be completely honest, our place couldn't be any more fabulous (see my previous blog entries for more raving about our place)....</p>

<p>The show itself is actually very cool -- each episode is a themed around a certain ball-park dollar amount, for example, $500,000.  They then feature a few homes (usually 3) in a 30 minute episode, each one in a different city in the U.S.  So that $500,000 space in New York is a studio, just shy of 600 square feet, while the $500,000 space in Dallas suburbs is a 3000 square feet, 4 Bedroom 3 Bath house on a 2 acres near a golf course, and maybe the $500,000 Los Angeles space is a swanky little modern pad on the hillside.</p>

<p>The show also focuses a lot more on the people and lifestyles, as well as the homes and spaces they live -- so there is a lot more for us to be nervous about!</p>

<p>Here's to our upcoming 15 minutes!  Set your Tivos, MythTV boxes, and PVRs to record (I'll post when the episode airs) -- super-stardom here we come!  </p>

<h3 class="title">piebar opening night</h3>

<p>Me, Jodi, and a friend of ours went to the "official" opening of <a href="http://www.piebar.com/">Piebar</a> tonight.  I'm a huge fan of another of Bob Amick's ventures, the aptly named successor to <b>One: Midtown Kitchen</b>, called <b>Two: Urban Licks</b> (mmm lambchop popsicles and that killer skyline view).</p>

<p>What a great space, and yes, it does have some funky space-ship style lighting, and if you are a true design snob, you will sneer at the interior decor, but dang, what a cool building and outdoor space (it would have been hard to mess it up).  As far as the food, well the pizzas...errr...pies were definitely out there.  Our shrimp, grits, pineapple, coffee pizza was actually not that bad, but the duck, mole, chili, queso fresco pizza was better.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.accessatlanta.com/arts/content/arts/0705/27piebar.html">good writeup from the AJC</a>.  Consider this my restaraunt review.  Now back to the regularly scheduled geekiness.</p>
