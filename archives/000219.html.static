<h3>omaha - rare. well done.</h3>

<p>"Omaha: Rare. Well Done."  reads the sign on the entrance banner from the airport.  Omaha is actually, pretty cool.  There's some wierd stuff out here, for instance, across the street from my hotel is ConAgra (fortune x00 mega-company), just across from a large "lake" is a fountain that shoots water 100s of feet in the air, constantly chaning color--the perfect backdrop to a huge multi-story Harrah's casino, and quite a few failed loft-style developments.  Just down the street is Mutual of Omaha, another fortune x00 mega-company, and an extremely cool downtown "old-market" area that despite all the failed developments is doing quite well (from the looks of it).  Definitely rare.  Sure, well done too.</p>

<p>I'm here for a 3-day training course on my company's product at Nebraska Methodist Health Services.  I was here just a month ago to teach the same course at Mutual of Omaha, I just learned both companies use the same mainframe systems, so naturally our company is loving the shared business.</p>

<p>I enjoy teaching, especially when the students are anxious to learn - I enjoy the challenge of coming to an entirely new place, finding new ways to explain concepts, and well - ok let's be honest, I liked it at first because it was challenging, heck, I was thrown in there after just learning the ropes, but that's why I liked it.  Now, it's getting to be routine.  I do enjoy it when my students are anxious to learn, and not just thrown in to some course to satisfy their company's traning quota.  I also like the power and respect of being that consultant who's backed by a lotta bucks (I was going to be honest, remember).  I guess I'm still frazzled (read: bitter) from the never-ending gov't contract project that keeps going and going - thanks tax-payers, I'm now a Marriott Platinum, and racking up tons of worthless SkyMiles!</p>

<p>How did I get so jaded?  And bored....</p>
