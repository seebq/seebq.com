      <h1>Biographical Information for Charles Brian Quinn</h1>
      <h2>short bio</h2>
      <p>
        Charles Brian Quinn, or CBQ, is the co-founder and CEO of Greenzie. Greenzie's software and off-the-shelf sensor suite add self-driving to commercial zero turn mowers to reduce the labor cost of lawn maintenance. OEMs equip Robotic Readyâ„¢ machines off the factory line with Greenzie Autonomous Mowing, enabling commercial landscaper fleets to utilize robotic workers on their crews. CBQ thinks software is the solution to most problems, just ask his wife and kids, who live in a fully automated home in Atlanta, GA.
