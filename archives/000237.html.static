<h3>bush won</h3>

<p>I just wish I only had one word to say:  goddamnit.  </p>

<p>But I don't.  I have quite a few words to say.  First, let me say that life will go on with Dubya as president.  America will continue to shine as the beacon of....aww fuck it....  America has an antiquated form of government that bases modern day decisions like partial-birth abortions, gay-marriage rights, deterrence/proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other such gems on a system comprised of a document enscribed by several old, white men wearing tights and wigs, escaping religious "persecution," created with the intentions that it would be easy to <i>amend</i> for the changing times, and a system of checks and balances that would ensure government would be run by the people, for the peo...  like I said, fuck it.</p>

<p>Well, you gotta think that the rest of the world with its &lt;sarcasm&gt;gay-loving, french-sympathizing, baby-killing, gun-hating &lt;/sarcasm&gt; out-look on life is thinking, (along with, oh, say 48% of America) what the fuck? </p>

<p>OK, so it can't be that bad, right?  As my pal <a href="http://www.omarzaki.com">Omar</a> reminds me: "Just remember my friend, it's never as good as the people who won say it is, but by the same token, it's never as bad as the losers will have you think."</p>

<p>For sure, though, as Americans, we can't make informed decisions (vote) or base our public-policy on what other people (the rest of the planet) think all the time, but for sure, maybe we should garner a little bit more support in the world-court (or whatever you'd like to call it) for our efforts.  If we really think something like imposing a democracy on Iraq, outlawing people having sex with members of the opposite sex, utilizing semi-automatic assault rifles with armor-piercing bullets for killing "deer," and implementing a Homeland Security policy complete with meaningless color-coded terror levels, maybe we should take a minute to think about the long-term implications for future generations.  Maybe.</p>

<p>OK, so what values should we base our decisions on?  When a majority of Americans seem to believe that the US is a experiencing a decline in moral  values (it started with that damn Clinton), well just what do we do?  Elect a leader whose Christian values of prayer and going to church and declaring gay marriage illegal?  No.  Unfortunately, most Americans may not admit it, but the values we share are hard work, intelligence, and, well, money.  Insert compasionate-conservative-gasp-at-crazy-liberal-view here.</p>

<p>Well, Omar, you are correct sir, maybe it's not that bad.  After all, he's only the Commander-In-Chief, and we do have several checks and balances (like our soon-to-be-even-more-conservative Supreme Court and GOP-majority House and Senate) to keep everything fair and balanced and running like a well oiled governmental machine.  I mean, the presidency may be an important job, but it's still a government job, and man do those suck.</p>

<p>I'm done.  Here's your recap:  George Bush won.  It sucks.  Election Reform.</p>
