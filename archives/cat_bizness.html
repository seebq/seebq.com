<h3 class="title">i'm calling it now</h3>

<p>This is really big news.  I'm calling it now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shareholder.com/paypal/releaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=171765&Category=US">PayPal Introduces New Micropayments Pricing to Increase the Convenience of Purchasing Digital Goods</a>.  It doesn't take much imagination to stretch this into no just digital goods, but maybe, Digital Services?</p>

<p>Tung also sent me <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=161937&cid=13537312">this link from a slashdot post</a> re: Ebay's plans to buy Skype (for some crazy large number), and I happen to believe in the commenter's predictions.  </p>

<p>Not only do I believe what this person is saying, but I am seeking to foster and promote this promotion of people and services, and rightly compensating those for providing and facilitating!</p>

<p>Just remember, you heard it here first.</p>

<h3 class="title">soon to be non-secret non-stealth-mode</h3>

<p>Those who know me well, may have had to put up with my non-specific rambling about what it is that I do for a living.  Many of you have probably heard me describe in a non-articulating kind of way, something about a top-secret super-stealth-mode startup project, and I do apologize for being so general.  Very soon we'll be unveiling the elusive "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_version">beta</a>."  So fear not, as we will launch our little baby out into the open, allowing for some hard-core beta testing from our core group of users -- p.s. that's you, if you're reading this blog.</p>

<p>It's been a crazy, hectic few months (actually, a year in total if you'll count the formulating, thinking, tinkering, and taking-the-plunge) trying to gear this puppy up and get her ready for not only beta, but the long road ahead.  Our goal is very noble, and if I must say, quite revolutionary.  </p>

<p>In the mean-time, I will give you a little bit of a teaser, because it does relate to our concept--our model--if you will....</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a> wanted to take a course on  an architectural program, called AutoCAD.  She naturally asked me to look into helping her find a course somewhere.  I looked around a little, but then thought, gosh, my friend <a href="http://www.kennethellsworth.com/">Kenny</a> really knows AutoCAD, being the Grad student (and full-time worker, I hear) he is, and he could probably do an excellent job of teaching.  I approached Kenny (read: e-mailed/IMed) and started to setup this interaction.  After all was settled and done, with me out of the picture, the price was negotiated, and the classes were started, I naturally remained eager to learn if my little recommendation was successful.  Now technically, there is no incentive for me, other than the nature of a good deed to follow up, or even see if the opportunity/interaction/deal goes along smoothly or at all.  No where am I getting a "cut" of the action, nor really would it be feasible, or acceptable socially, to initiate a fee or percentage for "hooking" it up -- the ole "finder's fee."</p>

<p>But why not?  What would happen if I did?  Would I have more of an incentive to make sure the class was going well?  Would I be in a better position to actually resolve conflicts, mediate efforts, or ensure success, with all parties knowing that my role is to "hook it up" and "ensure success?"  Where would I be if this kind of transaction went well, and how could Kenny repay me (monetarily or metaphysically) without a fully conscious-act: slipping me some money (I'd refuse) or going out of his way to allow me to continue to be an initiator of future "jobs" for him (not efficient or realistic)?</p>

<p>To that last sentence, I suppose you can see where I'm going -- that in reality, this concept loses merit, and yes, in an alternate system/game/network, it may be possible to persist.</p>

<p>The idea is simple, and sure, it's novel, and yes, it relies on the Interweb2.0/www.html-network-o-trust -- or whatever you call it....  But, it's definitely more than worth a shot.</p>

<p>Keep those RSS aggregators running -- there will be more, of course.  It's only a teaser, remember?</p>

<h3 class="title">What Business Can Learn from Open Source</h3>

<p>Thanks Tung (where's the blog?) for the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> link to: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">What Business Can Learn from Open Source</a>.</p>

<p>Excellent article coming out of some talks from OSCON.  Wish I was there -- I'm so <a href="http://www.benramsey.com/">jealous</a>.</p>

<p>From the article:<br />
<div class="comments-body"><br />
I think the big obstacle preventing us from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people working for you have to be employees. But think about what's going on underneath: the company has some money, and they pay it to the employee in the hope that he'll make something worth more than they paid him. Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship. Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him as investment? Then instead of coming to your office to work on your projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own.<br />
</div></p>

<p>Anyone who knows me, may know that this is truly something I believe in, and am a product of: my current "employer," whom I find myself referring to as my "sponsor" more often, has this arrangement with me.  I can attest that the "projects" I am involved with for my sponsor have been more wildly successful than we both could have imagined.  Why is that?  Why did I stay up crazy nights and weekends working on an end-to-end mobile-app running on Windows Mobile Smartphones, using Secure XML Web Services to a custom built app-server?  Why am I spending the weekends hacking linux kernels, assembling teams and scoping projects, working, and researching web development?  Because I love it and want to work on it!  </p>

<p>In all serious-ness, any coder/hacker would love to hear this -- and to play devil's advocate for just one second, there has to be a happy medium where too much freedom (or too much responsibility) can cause these kinds of relationships to fail.  I, personally believe that without having experienced a "corporate" job, to have a comparison and see what "billable hours" really means, or a well-rounded education (read: difficult, abstract, how-to-learn versus learn-one-thing-well) this wouldn't have worked.  But it is working!</p>

<p>And if you'll excuse me, I've got to back "work."  I've got shareholders and myself to please....</p>

<h3 class="title">multi-million dollar ideas</h3>

<p>My buddies and I have been on this weird topic of finding multi-million dollar ideas for a while now.  You know it's bad when you realize you are texting your buddies all day, shooting off ideas, and the responses come back with: "that's a $50,000 VC fund idea, max."  It's that kind of all-consuming conversation where there is no real "hey how's it going man, what's up," it's simply: "ok, how about a social networking site that's ...."  Unfortunately, it's either that or fall into that horrible horrible trap of being the atypical complaining software engineer/programmer/IT-dood who complains about how much everyone else pails in comparison with their coding/understanding/grasp on everything and the entirely predictable "I don't get paid enough for what I do" rant that I <em>used</em> to be guilty of too, I'll admit.  In fact, that actually gives me an idea....  </p>

<h3 class="title">blogging is so hott right now</h3>

<p>This Business Week On-Line article, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_18/b3931001_mz001.htm">Blogs Will Change Your Business</a> does an excellent job summing up the hype surrounding blogging, and does quite a good job at a little blogging 101.  </p>

<p>I happen to agree that businesses/individuals ought to jump on the bandwagon, if only to contribute to the new medium.  There are some really great benefits to putting a blog "out there."  Just to give an example, take for instance, a real estate agent.</p>

<p>Said Real Estate Agent puts out a blog that is, at first, simply a copy-paste of a newsletter update sent to friends/family/clients (not some auto-generated one, but with personal stuff too), and does a little bit of linking.  Perhaps talks about general blog type stuff, like, "went to Fox Theater this weekend.... did Habitat for Humanity....  Showed my favorite listing to some friends...."  Of course, linking the <em>listing</em> to an MLA listing, and others.</p>

<p>This accomplishes several things.  The Agent is now establishing in-bound link relevancy to search engines.  Since the agent claims to know such and such neighborhoods, and have such and such listings, and be the <insert-city-here> expert, it clearly indicates this by creating these links.  They now, also have a newsletter that is "free" to send, and posted "live" on the Internet.  Friends and family (and maybe prospective or future clients) can visit and find out what's happening with their favorite real estate agent.  Boom!</p>

<p>OK, I got it:  seebq.com Blogging Consultants, Inc.  I figure this idea is worth about 500k in VC money.  Who's in?</p>

<h3 class="title">performance indexing</h3>

<p>Today, there was a flurry of corporate memos e-mailed around, company-wide.  For a software company, unfortunately, that means lots of excel spreadsheets of performance data and charts.  Surprisingly, not a lot of powerpoint.  A shame, really.</p>

<p>Jumping on the bandwagon, I decided to perform a little performance analysis myself, on myself.  Here is part of the extensive research analysis:</p>
