<h3>le fromage est vieux</h3>

<p>Well, I'm in Paris.  Don't worry, my American buddies, I'm still a frog-bashing, brash, loud, rude, (stereotypically) American tourist living it up in Pah-ree....</p>

<div id="a000025more"><div id="more">
<p>The other night, a huge anti-war protest (more like a parade) came marching down the street towards Bastille.  This was only after they closed down the enitre street where my girlfriend lives, and a few around it.  There were tons of police (but they like protesting here as much as any other French person), so they stood around and smoked cigarrettes.  It was hilarious.  I heard someone on a loud speaker saying "Foock Gee-orge Boosh."  (that was my interpretation of the French accent).  It was a huge protest, it must have lasted for about 30-45 minutes, so I'm figuring it was a few thousand people.  Lots of loud music and flags, and shouting.</p>

<p>As for the title of this post, it means, "the cheese is oldy."  One of my favorite things to do here in Paris is make up cool statements, like "Je suis Paris" which means, "I am Paris."  Then I do my French laugh, a real gutteral "huhuhuh...."  I figure even the French can get a kick out of it.</p>

<p>You know, as much as I like to make fun of the French because of their lackadaisical lifestyles (and even more lackadaisical style of bathing), they don't have it that bad here.  In fact, they might even be doing pretty good for themselves.  </p>

<p>The parks here are amazing.  If I were a little kid, I would be in fantasy land.  One park we visited even had a giant hot air balloon in the middle that would take you up and then back down.</p>

<p>The museums are top-notch.  Maybe I just don't get out to museums in the US because it seems touristy, but the ones here are just plain cool.  And how can you compete with the Louvre?</p>

<p>I even like the metro, even though it is somewhat inefficient to get to some places, it sure beats rush-hour traffic, especially if you're a) with friends or b) getting sloshed at the bars.</p>

<p>I got some pictures of my exploits available on my new gallery software install, check 'em out at http://www.seebq.com/gallery/ .</p>

<p>'till next time kids, Au Revoir....</p>
