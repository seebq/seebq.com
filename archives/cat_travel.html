<h3 class="title">Work and Pleasure</h3>

<p>Let's just get this straight.  <a href="http://www.jodibell.com/">Jodi</a> and I went on an <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/italy">extended business trip</a>.  That's right, a fabulous business trip to Milan.  It just so happens, we spent the first week working in Milan, and then the next week meandering on over to <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/roma">Rome</a>, up the coast of Italy, and to Paris for a few days.</p>

<p>We hopped on a plane .... </p>

<p>on Sunday, April 10, headed for Milan, Italy.  When we arrived the next day, <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/showrooms/Salone_Internazionale_del_Mobile_036">Doug and Roy</a> put us to work.  We visited lots of showrooms around town, including Poliform, Driadre (where we saw Phillipe Starck) and then ended up at Cavalini's for dinner.  </p>

<p>Tuesday was more showroom snooping, and an incredible party in a renovated warehouse by <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/showrooms/Salone_Internazionale_del_Mobile_047">Capellini and Paltrona Frau</a> - unbelievably cool, and the pictures don't do it justice.  Just a design-frenzy filled with lots of booze, and beautiful people (and me).</p>

<p>On Wednesday, it was technically the first day of the fair, the Salone Internazionale del Mobiles.  We hit the big stuff, visiting the <a href="http://www.poliform.it">Poliform</a>, <a href="http://www.flexform.it/">Flexform</a>, and <a href="http://www.trep-trepiu.com/">Tre-Piu</a>.  Tre-Piu then took us to Lake Como, on the border of Italy and Switzerland, for dinner at Villa D'Este.  Once ranked one of the best restaraunts/hotels in the world, let me tell you that it was no let-down -- quite possibly the best meal I've ever had, hands down.  Incredibly beautiful little town.  We even had our own private Picasso museum tour and drinks before our fabulous dinner.  </p>

<p>Thursday was more fair, but I spent a good majority of the time working remotely (plus I was a little burnt out on design-design-design!)  Later that night was the Promemoria party at Romeo Sozzi's.  They had fabulous cocktails, and some DJs spinning house music, supplemented with some live instruments (trumpets, keyboards, sax).  Another swanky cocktail party down, more to go.</p>

<p>Friday was more of the fair, and we also traveled north of town to the Poliform Varrena Factory.  While I took lots of pictures of the showrooms there, the factory was off limits for pictures, but the tour was incredible.  What an amazing factory.  And to be able to see how our kitchen was made from start to finish was awesome.</p>

<p>Saturday, we took in the lighting at the fair (Luce!) and all the experimental stuff.  Flos, a big lighting company, had <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/salone?page=5">quite a controversial display</a> that couldn't help but be in your face-political.  One of the crappy, spray-painted, last-minute lamps they were pushing was in the shape of a gun, and said something like "happiness is a warm gun."  Cute, but we could have done without all the America sucks references surrounding it.  We get it, we suck.  Thanks a lot Europe.  We did run into that vibe, and it surprised us.  People up in arms and wanting to be political by being rude or refusing to do "business" with American companies.  I suppose over here we take politics for granted, or only really care when there's an election.  OK, I'm done with my political rambling.</p>

<p>Sunday was more showrooms, including both <a href="http://www.boffi.com/">Boffi</a> showrooms (hot hot hot) and some others I can't remember off the top of my head.  We then shot on over to the Bulgari hotel for some drink$. $ome expen$ive drink$.  We then ended up on Cavalini for dinner to end the work week.</p>

<p>The following Monday, Jodi and I hopped a train to <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/roma">Rome</a>.  We thought we'd be slick by not buying our return ticket to Paris, and what a mistake.  For some reason, it became difficult to get there on a decent train schedule because of strikes, and what not.  We ended up deciding to rent a car and drive back to Milan to take a day train to Paris, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  After securing our transportation, we ended up just having a nice dinner and going to bed, ready to explore Rome the next day.  </p>

<p>Rome was pretty cool.  We got to see the Coliseum, Palatino, Old Rome, the Jewish Ghetto, the Panthenon, and all that jazz.  Funny story:  We were going to go down to the Vatican City, but opted not.  As we were walking back, around 3:42pm on Tuesday, we hear lots of bells and see lots of people running/walking the in the opposite direction.  What had happened?  The new Pope was elected!  So, Jodi and I could have been there, cheering and drinking, and cursing and fighting and f---king celebrating with all the other Roman Catholics.....  </p>

<p>Wednesday we woke up earlier, jumped in our <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/roma/Roma_Pisa_Autonoleggio_Adventure_049">cute little rental car</a>, and got the heck out of dodge (or Rome).  We drove up to Pisa, and the drive was awesome.  Jodi drove like a bat out of hell (since there was no speed limit, or we just couldn't read it,being in Italian and all).  Pisa was, sadly, quite a dump, and the only good thing going for it was that leaning tower.  After taking <a href="http://www.seebq.com/gallery/roma/Roma_Pisa_Autonoleggio_Adventure_051">the obligatory picture</a>, we were outta there fast.  We ended up driving up the coast to Milan, and despite getting stuck in traffic in a huge tunnel, that drive was just amazing.  The highway seemed like it was mostly bridges over cities, tunnels through mountains (including mile long tunnels) with amazing views of the sea.</p>

<p>We arrived in Milan late, ate some dinner, and went to bed early for our 6am train to Paris.  Upon arriving in Paris, we checked in to the Marriott Champs Elysses, and started living the good life.  This had to have been one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed.  The room had a view of the Arc de Triumph, from the balcony with 2 french doors over Champs, stairs in the room, leading up to the huge bed, an awesome speaker system, huge bath, and just incredible amenities.  Since I happened to be a super-ultra-triple-diamond-Platinum Marriott member, having wasted...err.. spent over 120+ nights in a Marriott hotel in the previous year, they wasted no time in sending up a bottle of wine and cheese, and making sure we had quite a good time.</p>

<p>Since Jodi and I (well maybe just Jodi) are practically Parisian, we didn't do anything touristy.  We just tried to live like Parisians.  We did take in a cooking course at Le Cordon Bleu, but mainly went shopping and drinking cocktails and coffee at various trendy places while leisurely strolling around the city.  To say it was fabulous would be an understatement.</p>

<p>So, you see, it was a business/pleasure vacation with the emphasis on pleasure.  I'm ready to go back.</p>

<h3 class="title">Milano, Italia</h3>

<p>We made it to Italy.  Jodi and I are here for the <a href="http://www.cosmit.it/">Salone Internazionale del Mobile in Milano</a>.  Basically, it's like the International Contemporary (and non-contemporary) Furniture Fair that happens every year in NY, but of course, better.</p>

<p>We're having a blast, and have already gotten in trouble with fashion and furniture shopping in the fashion and furniture capital of the world.  Stay tuned for updates and blogging on the event, and some pictures, of course, lots of pictures....</p>

<p>ciao!</p>

<h3 class="title">South Africa - Dangerous Animal Day</h3>

<p>Sunday turned out to be Dangerous Animal day!  With my 2 o'clock Sharks Board dissection on the plate, Sandy suggested we continue the theme, so she took me to a Crocodile farm and reptile museum.  It was about 30 minutes out of Durban, near Umlali (pronounced Uhm-shlali).  They apparently farm crocodiles, which means they had quite a lot of these fellas, around 50 or so that were 2-3 years old and thus ready to sell out to breeders themselves, and quite a few mature (large) ones that were laying around all over the place.  They also had lots of baby crocs, and tons of incubating eggs in different areas.</p>

<p>We started off by walking ...</p>

<p>... through the various glass cages full of all kinds of poisonous African snakes, most were quite active when we walked by.  One of the Cobras even tried "attacking" the glass, and after seeing the lightning quick darts and bites on the glass, I could not imagine running into one of these in the wild.  They had the Black Mamba, which is one of the deadliest snakes in the world, with powerful neurotoxin venom that will actually paralyze you before you die from respiratory failure.  Owch.  They also had several python that were enormous, and lots of tree snakes that were colorful, but again, very deadly.  They also had several cages of injured owls and raptors (eagles, hawks, etc.) that had been hurt or sick -- they were still quite magnificent.  They also had a cage full of monkeys (very cute, social animals), and some ostriches.</p>

<p>After spending the morning there, we drove back just in time for the Sharks Board show.  It started off with the dissection, unfortunately, the movie introduction on Sharks was down (technical difficulties related to the sound -- I offered to try and help take a look at the setup, and they almost took me up on it, but instead apologized to everyone and let it remain broken).  The dissection was fascinating.  It was a bull-nose shark, not too big, but enough to make you scared to swim.  I have lots of pictures (in the gallery), if you're feeling brave!</p>

<p>After the show, Sandy dropped me off at the beach with some snacks, where I laid out for a while, and talked to some locals (they were probably trying to hustle me, but it was well enough and enjoyable chatting for a little while).  I walked up and down the beach, and didn't ever go swimming because I didn't want to leave my digital camera sitting by itself on my towel (not because I was thinking of all those sharks, eh).</p>

<p>After that, Sandy and I went to dinner at the Cargo hold, a restaurant in the downtown Durban Shaka Marine World, and it was incredible.  They had taken a large titanic-like vessel and turned the inside (the Cargo Hold) to a restaurant complete with an enormous tank with what must have been 30 foot glass walls surrounding hundreds of Pompano (silvery fish) and 4 large bull sharks.  While our table was one away from the glass, the sharks and fish were literally swimming around us (perhaps watching us eat their friends).  The food was excellent:  I had some languostines (like prawns/shrimp but similar to crawfish) that were fabulous and a King Club fish and vegetables.  After a nice cappuccino, it was back to lodge.</p>

<p>I keep forgetting I'm here to work, since it seems like one big vacation -- what an incredible opportunity and a gracious host (Sandy) helping me seize the opportunity to completely enjoy everything to the fullest!  I don't think the days could get better, but apparently they keep doing so!</p>

<h3 class="title">South Africa - Tala Game Reserve</h3>

<p>After waking up a bit late on Saturday morning, Sandy (our wonderful keeper) of the Gateway County Lodge invited me along with a fellow guest to visit a Natural Game Reserve, called <a href="http://www.tala.co.za/">Tala</a>, about an hour out of Durban.  I immediately said yes, and off we were, with a packed lunch and some borrowed binoculars.  It was absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>Now, keep in mind, this is a game reserve .... </p>

<p>.... out in the country-side, in Pietermaritzburg, only about 6,000 acres (still quite big), but in many of the pictures, you can see that it is indeed surrounded by farm land (even a factory farm off in the distance).  That is not to say it wasn't completely incredible - it indeed was stunning.</p>

<p>This game reserve has lodging for guests, and even Land Rovers that take guests out on tours, but you can take your own vehicle.  There were several places we were glad to be in Sandy's Landcruiser, in 4-wheel high.  We were immediately greeted by a herd of antelope (we actually saw several different kinds, including Impala, Nyala, and others).  After exploring for a while, encountering wildebeast, some wart-hogs (bush-pigs), an amazing assortment of birds, we veered off into the thornbush in search of some giraffe.  Lo and behold, I spotted one in the distance, and as we got closer, we realized it was a herd.  We were suddenly very close to the herd, and we didn't realize it, but since we were in their path, the larger males came meandering up to the front of the vehicle, and stopped, watching us, intently.  As they did that, the mothers and babies were ushered off behind us.  For a bit, they simply stood their ground, one even stopping to eat a little in front of us, all the while, very intelligently letting the babies head to safer ground.  When they were sufficiently behind, the males simply let us pass, and they continued on their way.  We must have been no more than 10-15 feet from these magnificent animals.</p>

<p>After our giraffe encounter, and a nice picnic lunch, we went in search of the rhino.  After chatting with a local guidesmen, we followed his directions and all of a sudden, there they were:  4 rhinos, sleeping near a watering hole.  We stopped to watch them, and they decided it was time to wake up and feed.  They were enormous!  I could go on and on, describing each encounter here, just as fascinating, but you'll have to visit the gallery to hear and see them all!</p>

<p>Today was amazing, and I still can't believe I'm "working" here - it feels like an incredible, fabulous vacation (with a tad bit of work thrown in for the mix)!</p>

<h3 class="title">South Africa</h3>

<p>The flight left Atlanta at 10:30am on Monday morning headed towards Johannesburg, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> (<a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/africa/za.htm">map</a>).  After a nice long (17 hour) journey, I arrived around 10:30am on Tuesday (Johannesburg is 7 hours ahead).  I didn't get much sleep on the plane (I never do), so I decided to try to power through the day.  I met my contact, Carel from CommerceQuest SA at the Arrivals gate, and we had 2 hours to kill before our flight to Durban.  I drank two cappuccinos, and we chatted about South Africa and such -- I even learned a little bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans_language">Afrikaans</a> (one of the many languages spoken in South Africa).  The flight to Durban was only an hour, on a small commuter plane.  While Pretoria is the capital of South Africa, Johannesburg is the largest city, and Durban is known as a tourist destination.  It's on the coast, and it does have a down-town area, but it also definitely has a laid-back feeling to the city.  </p>

<p>Upon arriving in Durban, ... </p>

<p>... we were met by Sean, another CommerceQuest SA guy who took us to our lodging in Umhlanga (pronounced, Uhm-schlonga).  We are staying at the <a href="http://www.gatewaycountrylodge.co.za/">Gateway Country Lodge</a>, a bed and breakfast lodge that is amazing.  It's a small ranch, on 2 acres, overlooking fields of sugarcane and just down the road from the beach.  Each suite has it's own patio, overlooking a beautifully manicured garden and pool.  The owner Sandy, has lived there her entire life.  She even has a small tortoise garden with some pretty big fellas, and several dogs, including a little Jack Russell named Tiger!  </p>

<p>The plan was to let me rest, but I was too anxious to get out and do some exploring, and, quite honestly, a little thirsty for a beer.  We decided to venture out, and after visiting a Durban mall (unfortunately, it was exactly like any other mall, just with different stores), we went down to the beach to meet the other consultants from Business Connexion.  We met them at a small patio restaurant, right on the beach.  After several good South African beers, and some good conversation (OK, so it was tech-talk), I was beginning to feel a little tired.  This was probably around hour 32 for me, if you don't count the half-nap/half-awake time on the plane.  We then went to go grab a bite to eat, and I'll be honest, I was beginning to feel very tired.  I ordered a steak and some chips (they were Freedom Fries, eh), and I don't know if it was the exhaustion or deliria, but it was a damn good steak.  It had some spicy pepper sauce and mushrooms, and it was fantastic.  I have realized that I am getting old when the highlight of my traveling is the food, but if that's how it is, then yes, I will see a menu, thank you.</p>

<p>I made it back to our lodging, and crashed out by 9:00pm.  It was a nice deep sleep.  I woke up around 6:00am, and decided to walk around (with Tiger) and take some pictures of the garden and lodge.  The lodging had breakfast served at 7:00, and it was incredibly good as well.  I ended up eating a bit too much, wanting to try everything, including the fresh mangos, grapefruits, chicken-bacon, biscuits, muffins, eggs, fresh yogurt, orange-nectar juice, and coffee.  Old geyser, I know.</p>

<p>We set off for the offices in downtown Durban, in a municipal building that, sadly could have used some work - much like most of the other buildings in the area.  I quickly was brought up to speed, and shown the already pre-setup environment and network where we'd be doing our integration work.  The only bad part is, the network was fast, the servers were decent, but there was no Internet connection!  One guy had a dial-up that we took turns on, but I didn't have much time, other than to let everyone know that, yes, I was still alive, and to confirm all the American stereotypes that there were, indeed, elephants, tigers, lions, and giraffes running around in the streets.  </p>

<p>To be honest, the streets of Durban are quite different from other cities I've been to.  Yes, they drive on the "wrong" side of the road (being a former British colony), and the "taxi" system consists of these vans, most blaring rap/pop music, complete with decals and flashy paint jobs, tearing around town holding out different symbols that indicate what route/where they are heading.  They are constantly pulling over, and picking up more people.  You can definitely tell that ramifications of Apartheid and racial differences will take a while to undo.  It's hard to explain, but there is tension among many of the different people/races/cultures.  Alas, I suppose this is true of many nations where there are lots of different cultures living together.  The downtown of Durban definitely was going through a phase of "abandonment" -- I had heard that most of the businesses were moving to office parks out in the "suburbs" or countryside.  You could tell some buildings were just left empty.  </p>

<p>After work, we went to an Internet-cafe where I found out that my wireless card does not support the newer security called WPA-PSK or wireless pass-key technology - so I was out of luck.  I sure hope these one minute calls from my roaming cell-phone, long-distance to the States don't cost more than the AT&T credit card calls I tried to make from a local phone at 15 dollars for the first minute, and 3 dollars after that with a 15% fee (owch).  Though, I have a sinking feeling they do.</p>

<p>Another early evening, and a good next day at work (without too much breakfast) brings us to going out for drinks with the business analyst on-site and a delightful chap named Charles who, when I met him, mentioned that he recognized me from seebq.com -- he googled me before I came on-site!  If you're reading this Charles, then "cheers, oak!"  We went to an awesome place on the harbor where I had ostrich and couscous.  It was, again, fabulous.  The conversation was good, the food was good, and unfortunately, the cocktails were quite good too.</p>

<p>Waking up a bit early with a bit of a headache on Friday, I went inside the house and quickly drank a large glass of juice, and a bottle of water.  I then promptly headed back to bed, and woke up just before 7 to shower and go to breakfast.  Friday at work turned out to be a good day -- we completed lots of work, and resolved several issues.  Carel left early to go back to Jo'burg for a bachelor's party, and Shaun left at 4:30.  Charles graciously took me back to the b-and-b, where I began to relax.  Sandy mentioned a show, called Footprint of Africa - a musical-show with African roots (and Zulu dancers) at a nearby entertainment complex.  She arranged to take me, drop me off, and help me buy one of the last tickets (literally, there were only two left at 100Rand = $60), and even arranged to come pick me up (she was going to next weekend).  The show was quite good - definitely interesting, and had some amazing dancers.  </p>

<p>We actually dropped off two of Sandy's workers -- maids and gardeners in their village on the way to the complex, and despite my coaxing them to teach me their native Zulu dialect (it had the clicking sound in it!), they simply giggled at the funny American.  The area where they lived was quite sad, actually, tiny homes, but I learned they were built by government/volunteer/missionaries to provide free housing to combat the shantytowns that are famous in South Africa.  I suppose it was better, but not by much.</p>

<p>The Entertainment and Casino complex itself deserves a little bit of explanation -- being in the middle of nowhere, and suddenly rising out of the sugarcane fields it all it's splendor and neon glory.  It was quite absurd, actually, and I took lots of pictures.  Even though I had time to kill before and after the show, I couldn't bring myself to do any gambling.  I didn't want to figure out the silly slots games (before the payout line, bet your doubled up credits on a 3x multiplier payback?) nor could I find any real poker.  Gosh I just realized those gambling sites who come by my blog and comment-spam the crap out of me are going to have a field day with this one - oh well.</p>

<p>That brings me to now, sitting in my room with the patio open, the rain falling, then pouring, then stopping, and then me getting scared, hearing way too many strange noises outside to keep these doors open while I type up this off-line blog entry.  I did finally see some wild monkeys this morning, playing in the trees outside, and as cute as they were, I was told they like to come in to your room, steal your food, bite you if you mess with them, and they have rabies!</p>

<p>This weekend I am going to the beach, relaxing, and visiting the Sharks Board (where they dissect a Great White that gets caught in the shark nets they have on the beach).  Surprisingly, I heard these nets are actually placed a short distance out from the beach, and have space on top and bottom and in between.  Usually they are enough to deter sharks from coming close to the shore, but occasionally, they do get through, and quickly become "claustrophobic" being so close to the shore that they turn around and get caught in the nets on the way back out.  These are the ones the Shark Board dissects as a show to teach kids about them.  It is the field-trip/rainy-day activity of all school children in the Durban area.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to a great weekend, and an even better next weekend - since I'm going on a full safari at a lodge on a reserve!  You can be sure I'll be taking some more pictures!</p>
