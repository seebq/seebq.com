<h3>now i get it</h3>

<p>I was listening to talk-radio the other day, and to be honest, I listen to several talk-radio programmes every Monday and Friday on my drive to/from Nashville.  We all know that radio is where the right-wing nut jobs hang out, c'mon y'all, let's admit it.  I think as soon as you can accept that radio DJs have only 2 real objectives, the better off you are.</p>

<p>1) Entertainment.  Pure, and simple.  Yes, Rush Limbaugh is upset.  He is, in fact, yelling.  And, yes, he is always up in arms about something.  If you don't agree, chances are you'll listen and laugh (or get mad at him).  If you do happen to agree (after or before the yelling), chances are you'll listen and just get madder with him.  Damn that <a href="http://www.cbs.com">liberal gay jew run media</a>.</p>

<p>2) Commercials.  I believe <a href="http://www.hannity.com">Sean Hannity</a> put this one best, when he was talking about something or other, repeating something about 9/11 changing how he walks his dog, and then he told me about 1-800-USA-DOOR -- which provides quality overhead and garage doors, built in America.  He says that they do "extensive criminal background checks, and drug-screening of all their service technicians," so it's safe!  No, wait, I believe it was <a href="http://www.boortz.com">Neal Boortz</a> (Atlanta, GA syndicated) who was talking about vinyl siding, or was it gutter cleaning or fucking-old-people-insurance, and you know, he did mention clearly that the terrorists were going to come into your home and bomb your duplex and rape your dog and steal your wife and drink the milk straight from the jug without using a glass if you didn't get real scared and buy American Products.  I think that was the gist of it.</p>

<p>I'm so over talk-radio.  How about, <a href="http://www.pocket-tunes.com/">pTunes</a> on my Treo600, streaming one of those ShoutCast Radio stations?  Now if only I could find a <a href="http://www.norobotsallowed.com">good one</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for the blog, Brian.  You blog so good.  And way to go posting two articles from (my opinion, that I've found anyway) the two best  sources or intelligent articles on the net today, Cato and Reason.  I will start bloggin again soon.  I picked up a Canadian magazine today you would enjoy.  Check out Maisonneuve Underground, your source of eclectic curiosity...from Canada I guess.  I tried to link to it, but shit filtered out my HTML.  Oh well, guess you will have to search yourself.</p>
